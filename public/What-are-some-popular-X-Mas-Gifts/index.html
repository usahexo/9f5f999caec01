<h1 id="What-is-the-best-X-Mas-Gift"><a href="#What-is-the-best-X-Mas-Gift" class="headerlink" title="What is the best X-Mas Gift?"></a>What is the best X-Mas Gift?</h1><p>Christmas is a time for family, friends and of course - gifts! But what’s the best thing to give your loved ones this season? We’ve rounded up some of the most popular gift ideas for Christmas 2017.</p>
<p>For Her</p>
<p>Jewelry is always a popular Christmas gift for women. You can never go wrong with a pretty necklace, ring or bracelet. If you’re looking for something a bit more unique, consider purchasing an item of jewelry with a personal meaning attached.</p>
<p>Another great idea for women is to give them a voucher for a day at a spa or beauty salon. This will allow her to relax and enjoy some pampering time during the busy festive period.</p>
<p>For Him</p>
<p>If you’re not sure what to get your partner or husband for Christmas, why not try something that’s practical? A nice watch, wallet or set of golf clubs are all great gifts that he can use and enjoy.</p>
<p>If your man is into technology, then why not buy him the latest gadget? Alternatively, you could purchase him tickets to his favorite sports game or concert. Tickets make great gifts as they are both memorable and practical.</p>
<p>For Kids</p>
<p>The best Christmas gift for kids is usually something that they can play with and enjoy. This could be anything from a new toy to an afternoon at the amusement park. If you want to get really creative, why not make your child their own personalized present? This could be anything from a drawing you’ve made yourself to a homemade book filled with photos and memories.</p>
<h1 id="When-did-people-start-exchanging-gifts-at-Christmas"><a href="#When-did-people-start-exchanging-gifts-at-Christmas" class="headerlink" title="When did people start exchanging gifts at Christmas?"></a>When did people start exchanging gifts at Christmas?</h1><p>The exchanging of gifts at Christmas is a tradition that has been around for centuries. Although the precise origin of this tradition is unknown, there are several plausible theories about how it began.</p>
<p>One popular theory is that the tradition of exchanging gifts at Christmas originated with the wise men who visited Jesus shortly after he was born. According to the Bible, these men gave Jesus presents of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. It is possible that other people began to emulate the wise men by giving gifts to their friends and family members at Christmas time.</p>
<p>Another theory suggests that the tradition of gift-giving at Christmas began as a way to celebrate the winter solstice. The winter solstice occurs on December 21st each year, and it marks the shortest day of the year. Some people may have begun exchanging gifts as a way to bring cheer to people during what can be a dark time of year.</p>
<p>Whatever its origins may be, the tradition of exchanging gifts at Christmas is now a cherished part of many cultures around the world. People often enjoy selecting special gifts for their loved ones during this festive time of year.</p>
<h1 id="Why-do-people-give-each-other-presents-at-Christmas"><a href="#Why-do-people-give-each-other-presents-at-Christmas" class="headerlink" title="Why do people give each other presents at Christmas?"></a>Why do people give each other presents at Christmas?</h1><p>One of the most common questions about Christmas is why people give each other presents. This custom can be traced back to the Roman festival of Saturnalia, which was held in honor of Saturn, the god of agriculture. During this celebration, people exchanged gifts with each other.</p>
<p>The tradition of giving presents at Christmas was brought to Britain by Saint Nicholas, who was born in Turkey in the 4th century. According to legend, Saint Nicholas became a bishop and gave away all his money to help the poor. He was also known for leaving gifts in the shoes of people who left them out to dry overnight.</p>
<p>In the 18th century, Christmas became a popular holiday in Britain. The custom of giving presents gradually spread to other countries. Today, giving presents is a universal custom that is enjoyed by people all over the world.</p>

But what are the most popular Christmas gifts in the UK?</p>
<p>According to a survey by YouGov, the most popular Christmas gifts in the UK are gift cards, followed by clothes and then cosmetics.</p>
<p>Gift cards are a popular choice because they allow the recipient to choose their own present. And who doesn’t like getting a new outfit for Christmas? Cosmetics are also a popular choice, as they can be used to make someone feel special on Christmas day.</p>
<p>Other popular gifts include books, games and vouchers. So if you’re stuck for ideas about what to buy someone for Christmas, why not try one of these gifts?</p>
