        <h1 id="Betting-on-home-favorites-How-UNICS-benefits-from-Smart-Money"><a href="#Betting-on-home-favorites-How-UNICS-benefits-from-Smart-Money" class="headerlink" title="Betting on home favorites: How UNICS benefits from Smart Money"></a>Betting on home favorites: How UNICS benefits from Smart Money</h1><p>When we think about basketball, the first thing that comes to mind is usually the NBA. The players are bigger, faster, and stronger. They can jump out of the gym and make shots from anywhere on the court. However, there is another league that is often overlooked, but should not be underestimated. The Russian Professional Basketball League, also known as the VTB United League, is home to some of the best basketball players in the world. And one team in particular has found great success thanks to so-called “smart money”.</p>
<p>UNICS Kazan is a professional basketball club that competes in the VTB United League and EuroCup. Founded in 2005, UNICS has become one of the most successful clubs in Russia. They have won six championships and five cups. However, they have never been able to win a title in Europe until last year when they became champions of the EuroCup.</p>
<p>There are many factors that have led to UNICS’s success over the years, but one of the most important has been their ability to attract smart money. This is when big investors or institutions bet on a team to win despite them being heavy underdogs. In other words, these investors are not betting on what they see as the most likely outcome, but rather on what they believe is going to happen regardless of the odds. And this is where UNICS has benefited immensely.</p>
<p>The team has always had a lot of talent, but they have never been able to overcome teams like CSKA Moscow or Olympiacos Piraeus who are considered by many to be much better than them. However, with smart money coming in on UNICS, they have been able to compete against these teams and even beat them on occasion. This was evident during their championship run in the EuroCup last year where they upset teams like CSKA Moscow and FC Barcelona en route to winning the title.</p>
<p>While it is impossible to know for sure whether or not UNICS would have been able to achieve this level of success without attracting smart money, it certainly seems that it has played a key role in their success. This is because it has allowed them to compete against better teams and ultimately win more games. As a result, UNICS should continue to benefit from this type of investment in the years ahead.</p>
<h1 id="UNICS-cashes-in-as-huge-home-favorite-against-Slovan"><a href="#UNICS-cashes-in-as-huge-home-favorite-against-Slovan" class="headerlink" title="UNICS cashes in as huge home favorite against Slovan"></a>UNICS cashes in as huge home favorite against Slovan</h1><p>In a matchup which pits together two of the strongest squads in the VTB United League, UNICS Kazan was made -10 point home favorites against Slovak side Slovan Bratislava. Despite being somewhat undersized, UNICS has continued to win by playing tough, fundamental basketball with an inside-out gameplan. They are coming off a 113-100 victory against league powerhouse CSKA Moscow and have now won 3 of their last 4 games.</p>
<p>Slovan Bratislava is no pushover squad, however. They come into this contest with an 8-5 record, having most recently knocked off defending champions Zenit Saint Petersburg. Led by American guard Norris Cole, they boast a versatile and explosive offense that can score in bunches. With both teams looking to make a statement in this matchup, it should be an intriguing battle to watch.</p>
<p>Despite being at home, UNICS may not be able to cover the large spread as they have been somewhat inconsistent as of late. Look for Slovan Bratislava to keep things close throughout and possibly pull off the upset as 10 point underdogs.</p>
<h1 id="UNICS-as-1-5-point-favorite-against-Kalev-in-Estonia"><a href="#UNICS-as-1-5-point-favorite-against-Kalev-in-Estonia" class="headerlink" title="UNICS as 1.5 point favorite against Kalev in Estonia"></a>UNICS as 1.5 point favorite against Kalev in Estonia</h1><p>UNICS Kazan will be a 1.5 point favorite when they face Kalev in Estonia on Saturday. The Russian side is coming off of an 84-75 victory over ASVEL Basket in their last outing, while Kalev lost to Nizhny Novgorod by 14 points in their latest game. UNICS has been one of the better teams in Europe this season, as they come into this matchup with a 9-4 record. Kalev has not been as strong this year, as they come into this matchup with a 6-8 record.</p>
<p>UNICS has been led by Alexey Shved and Keith Langford this season. Shved is averaging 15.9 points per game, while Langford is averaging 14.3 points per game. These two players have been able to score the ball at will for UNICS and they will need to continue to do so against Kalev on Saturday. Kalev has been led by Marcelus Kemp this season. Kemp is averaging 18.7 points per game, while Rimantas Kaukenas is averaging 12.1 points per game. These two players have been able to score the ball effectively for Kalev and they will need to do so against UNICS on Saturday.</p>
<p>UNICS has played well on both ends of the court this season and they should be able to beat Kalev on Saturday. Shved and Langford have been outstanding offensively for UNICS this season and they should be able to lead the team to victory on Saturday.</p>
<h1 id="Bookmakers-see-UNICS-as-240-favorites-over-visiting-Asseco-Prokom"><a href="#Bookmakers-see-UNICS-as-240-favorites-over-visiting-Asseco-Prokom" class="headerlink" title="Bookmakers see UNICS as -240 favorites over visiting Asseco Prokom"></a>Bookmakers see UNICS as -240 favorites over visiting Asseco Prokom</h1><p>The UNICS Kazan basketball team is considered a heavy favorite by bookmakers when they host the Asseco Prokom Sopot club this week in the Russian Super League. UNICS is listed as -240 favorites at leading sportsbooks, with Asseco Prokom coming back at +190 underdogs and the point spread set at 14.5 points in favor of UNICS.</p>
<p>UNICS (9-4) enters this matchup on the heels of a 103-81 victory over Triumph Lyubertsy, while Asseco Prokom (7-6) suffered a 111-87 home loss to CSKA Moscow. The two teams last met on January 16, 2011 with UNICS earning an 83-75 road win.</p>
<p>UNICS has been one of the most consistent clubs in Europe this season, with only one loss in their past 10 games. The squad is paced by American guard MarShon Brooks, who is averaging 18.8 points per game and tops all players in scoring during Euroleague competition. Russian forwards Andrey Vorontsevich and Sergey Karasev are also averaging double figures for UNICS this season.</p>
<p>Asseco Prokom has had a more up-and-down season, with just two wins in their past six games. However, the team does have some quality talent including Americans Demetris Nichols and Scotty Hopson and Lithuanian center Robertas Javtokas. Nichols is averaging 15.3 points per game this season and leads Asseco Prokom in scoring during Euroleague play.</p>
<h1 id="How-does-the-public-money-flow-betting-market-look-for-UNICS-v-Valencia"><a href="#How-does-the-public-money-flow-betting-market-look-for-UNICS-v-Valencia" class="headerlink" title="How does the public money flow betting market look for UNICS v Valencia?"></a>How does the public money flow betting market look for UNICS v Valencia?</h1><p>In this article, we will be analyzing how the public money flow betting market looks for the upcoming game between UNICS and Valencia.</p>
<p>To start off, let’s take a look at the opening odds for this game. As of right now, UNICS is the slight favorite to win with odds of -175 at most sportsbooks. Valencia is currently sitting at +155 on the moneyline.</p>
<p>Looking at the total points line, it opened at 166.5 and has since shifted to 167.5. So it would appear that the market believes there is a good chance this game ends up being close.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at how the public is betting this game so far. Unsurprisingly, Valencia is receiving roughly 60% of all bets placed thus far. This shouldn’t come as much of a surprise given they are the underdog in this matchup. However, what’s more interesting is that UNICS’ share of bets has actually decreased slightly from its opening number.</p>
<p>So what does all of this mean? Well, it appears that the market believes Valencia has a decent chance of pulling off the upset in this game. UNICS is still the favorite to win, but not by as wide of a margin as some may have thought initially.</p>
