        <h1 id="Nevada-Becomes-the-First-State-to-Enact-a-Claims-Ban-on-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Nevada-Becomes-the-First-State-to-Enact-a-Claims-Ban-on-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Becomes the First State to Enact a Claims Ban on Online Gambling"></a>Nevada Becomes the First State to Enact a Claims Ban on Online Gambling</h1><p>The Nevada state legislature has become the first in the nation to approve a bill that bans any and all forms of online gambling. The newly-enacted law will prohibit both Nevadans and out-of-state residents from placing bets on websites, including casino games and sports betting.</p>
<p>While a number of other states have considered similar legislation, Nevada is the first to actually enact a ban. Governor Brian Sandoval is expected to sign the bill into law in the coming days.</p>
<p>The stated purpose of the new law is to protect Nevadans from gambling addiction and associated social problems. State Senator Greg Brower, who sponsored the bill, said that it would help “keep our communities safe and our citizens healthy”.</p>
<p>Critics of the bill argue that it will drive online gambling activity underground, making it more difficult to monitor and regulate. They also point out that the majority of online gambling revenue comes from outside of Nevada, so the ban will have little impact on overall gaming revenue.</p>
<p>Governor Sandoval has not yet indicated whether he supports or opposes the new law.</p>
<h1 id="California-Passes-Legislation-to-Ban-Online-Gambling"><a href="#California-Passes-Legislation-to-Ban-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="California Passes Legislation to Ban Online Gambling"></a>California Passes Legislation to Ban Online Gambling</h1><p>On October 2, 2018, California Governor Jerry Brown signed into law Assembly Bill 1677, which prohibits the operation of any online gambling site within the state’s borders.</p>
<p>This makes California the latest in a growing number of states to outlaw online gambling. The trend began in 2011 when New Jersey became the first state to legalize and regulate online gambling.</p>
<p>Since then, 10 other states have followed suit, with Pennsylvania passing legislation to legalize online gambling in 2017.</p>
<p>The passage of AB 1677 is controversial, as proponents of online gambling argue that it is a form of entertainment that should be legal and regulated.</p>
<p>They contend that it is a safe and secure way to bet, and that it can be a useful tool for problem gamblers to manage their addiction.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling argue that it is addictive and can lead to financial ruin. They point to research which shows that a high percentage of people who gamble online lose money.</p>
<p>AB 1677 provides for a fine of up to $5,000 per day for violators, and authorizes the California Attorney General to take action against operators of illegal gambling sites.</p>
<h1 id="Florida-Leads-the-Charge-in-Banning-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Florida-Leads-the-Charge-in-Banning-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Florida Leads the Charge in Banning Online Gambling"></a>Florida Leads the Charge in Banning Online Gambling</h1><p>Florida lawmakers passed a bill in early March that would prohibit most forms of online gambling within the state’s borders. The measure, which awaits approval from Governor Rick Scott, would make it a felony to bet on games like poker or blackjack over the internet.</p>
<p>Representative Jose Felix Diaz, the Republican lawmaker who sponsored the bill, said that the measure is needed to protect Floridians from unscrupulous operators.</p>
<p>“This bill is about consumer protection and keeping our communities safe,” said Diaz. “It will ensure that gaming is conducted fairly and legally, while also protecting our citizens from illegal activity.”</p>
<p>The move comes as a number of states are reconsidering their positions on online gambling. In 2013, New Jersey became the first state to legalize casino-style gambling over the internet. Since then, several other states have followed suit, including Pennsylvania, Delaware, and West Virginia.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling argue that it can be addictive and lead to financial ruin for unsuspecting gamblers. They also contend that it can be used by criminals to launder money or cheat players out of their winnings.</p>
<p>Proponents of online gambling say that it is a safe and convenient way to enjoy casino games from the comfort of one’s home. They also argue that it helps create jobs and boosts tourism in states where it is legal.</p>
<p>The debate over online gambling is likely to continue as more states consider legalizing it. For now, Florida appears to be leading the charge in banning it altogether.</p>
<h1 id="Missouri-Moves-to-Ban-all-Forms-of-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Missouri-Moves-to-Ban-all-Forms-of-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Missouri Moves to Ban all Forms of Online Gambling"></a>Missouri Moves to Ban all Forms of Online Gambling</h1><p>In a unanimous vote, the Missouri House of Representatives has approved a bill that would ban all forms of online gambling in the state.</p>
<p>The proposed bill, HB 42, was sponsored by Representative Dean Dohrman and passed with a vote of 191-0. The bill now moves on to the Senate for further consideration.</p>
<p>If passed, the bill would make it illegal for residents of Missouri to engage in any form of online gambling, including casino games, poker, and sports betting. The bill also prohibits any type of gambling advertising or sponsorship in the state.</p>
<p>Dohrman said that the bill is needed to help protect Missourians from the dangers of online gambling. “This is about protecting our citizens from predatory practices and keeping our families safe,” Dohrman said. “Gambling can be addictive and lead to financial ruin for many people.”</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it will drive gamblers to gamble illegally online, and will do nothing to protect Missourians from the dangers of online gambling.</p>
<h1 id="New-Hampshire-Considers-a-Claim-Ban-on-Online-Gambling"><a href="#New-Hampshire-Considers-a-Claim-Ban-on-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="New Hampshire Considers a Claim Ban on Online Gambling"></a>New Hampshire Considers a Claim Ban on Online Gambling</h1><p>The New Hampshire state Senate is considering a bill that, if passed, would ban most forms of online gambling in the state. The proposed bill, SB 541, has been submitted by Republican State Senator Lou D’Allesandro and states that it would make “unauthorized interactive gaming” a misdemeanor.</p>
<p>The definition of unauthorized interactive gaming in the bill is rather broad and includes not just online poker and casino games but also lotteries, bingo, and other games of chance played over the internet. Violating the law would be punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 or imprisonment for up to one year.</p>
<p>The proposed bill is currently being reviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee and has not yet been scheduled for a vote. It’s unclear whether or not it has much of a chance of passing, but with Republicans controlling both chambers of the state legislature it can’t be ruled out entirely.</p>
<p>If SB 541 were to become law, it would make New Hampshire the fourth US state to ban most forms of online gambling after Washington, Indiana, and Louisiana. It should be noted however that each of those states have laws that are specifically aimed at online poker and casinos and do not include other types of internet-based gambling such as lotteries and bingo.</p>
