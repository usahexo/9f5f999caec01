<p>The casino, which cost $2.4 billion to build, was forced into bankruptcy in March of 2014. It had been hoped that the casino would be saved by its Florida owner, Glenn Straub, but it appears he has instead decided to sell the property.</p>
<p>While the identity of the new owner has not yet been revealed, it is speculated that it may be billionaire Carl Icahn. Mr. Icahn currently owns several casinos in Atlantic City, including the Tropicana and Trump Taj Mahal.</p>
<p>It is unknown what Mr. Icahn plans to do with the Revel Casino, but it is hoped that he will be able to restore it to its former glory.</p>
<h1 id="XProGaming-Casino-Appears-to-be-Sold"><a href="#XProGaming-Casino-Appears-to-be-Sold" class="headerlink" title="XProGaming Casino Appears to be Sold"></a>XProGaming Casino Appears to be Sold</h1><p>For the past few days, there have been rumors that XProGaming Casino has been sold. This morning, the confirmation finally came.</p>
<p>According to an article on Casino Guardian, the casino has been sold to an unknown buyer for an undisclosed amount of money. The new owner is said to be a “private investor.”</p>
<p>It is not clear what this means for XProGaming Casino’s future. However, it is safe to say that things will be changing in the coming months.</p>
<p>This news comes as a bit of a surprise since the casino has been struggling financially in recent months. In fact, there were reports just a few weeks ago that the casino was on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what happens next at XProGaming Casino. In the meantime, we will just have to wait and see what changes come about in the coming months.</p>
<h1 id="Mystery-Buyer-of-Revel-Casino-Revealed"><a href="#Mystery-Buyer-of-Revel-Casino-Revealed" class="headerlink" title="Mystery Buyer of Revel Casino Revealed"></a>Mystery Buyer of Revel Casino Revealed</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>The identity of the mystery buyer of Atlantic City’s Revel Casino has been revealed.</p>
<p>According to reports, the buyer is none other than Bruce Deifik, a Colorado businessman and owner of the Hyatt Regency Resort in Greenwood Village.</p>
<p>Deifik is said to have paid $200 million for the casino, which had gone bankrupt and closed down in 2014.</p>
<p>The reopening of Revel is seen as a positive sign for Atlantic City, which has been struggling in recent years due to increased competition from casinos in neighboring states.</p>
<h1 id="Another-Atlantic-City-Casino-Falls-into-Ownership-Dispute"><a href="#Another-Atlantic-City-Casino-Falls-into-Ownership-Dispute" class="headerlink" title="Another Atlantic City Casino Falls into Ownership Dispute"></a>Another Atlantic City Casino Falls into Ownership Dispute</h1><p>Atlantic City, long known as a popular destination for casino gambling and nightlife, has been in the news recently for a different reason. The city’s fourth largest casino, the Borgata, is now in the midst of a legal dispute between its two owners.</p>
<p>The dispute centers around allegations of mismanagement and financial malfeasance by the casino’s current CEO, Tom Goldstein. Goldstein was hired in 2014 by the casino’s original owner, Boyd Gaming Corporation. However, in early 2017 Boyd Gaming decided to sell its stake in the Borgata to MGM Resorts International.</p>
<p>Goldstein refused to sell his shares to MGM and has instead chosen to file a lawsuit against Boyd Gaming. He alleges that the company reneged on an agreement to let him continue running the casino after the sale. Boyd Gaming denies any wrongdoing and has countersued Goldstein for breach of contract.</p>
<p>The legal battle is playing out in courtrooms both in Atlantic City and Las Vegas and is expected to last for some time. In the meantime, it is causing some uncertainty among Borgata employees and guests about the future of the casino.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that ownership problems have beset Atlantic City casinos. In late 2016, Tropicana Entertainment became embroiled in a legal battle with its former Chinese owner over control of that casino. And Trump Taj Mahal, once one of Atlantic City’s most iconic properties, went through a bankruptcy reorganization in 2016 after its original owner, Donald Trump, lost control of it.</p>
<h1 id="Who-Owns-Revel-Casino-Remains-a-Mystery"><a href="#Who-Owns-Revel-Casino-Remains-a-Mystery" class="headerlink" title="Who Owns Revel Casino Remains a Mystery"></a>Who Owns Revel Casino Remains a Mystery</h1><p>More than two years after Revel Casino’s closure, the ownership of the building remains a mystery.</p>
<p>Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, a law firm hired by Revel’s bankruptcy trustee, reported in a filing this week that it has been “unable to identify the current owner or owners” of the property.</p>
<p>The finding is contained in a 14-page report filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Camden, which is handling Revel’s Chapter 11 case.</p>
<p>The casino closed on Sept. 2, 2014, after just over two years of operation, and the property has been up for sale ever since. But it has failed to attract any serious buyers.</p>
<p>In its report, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell said it had reached out to “numerous potential stakeholders,” but none of them was willing to provide information about the current ownership of the property.</p>
<p>That left the law firm with no other option but to file a motion with the court seeking permission to hire an investigative firm to determine who currently owns Revel.</p>
<p>A hearing on that motion is scheduled for Jan. 19.</p>
<p>Revel’s ownership has been a mystery since shortly after it opened in 2012. Back then, it was controlled by Glenn Straub, a Polo-loving Palm Beach billionaire who bought it at auction for $82 million — well below the $2 billion that had been spent on its construction.</p>
<p>Straub never revealed who his financial backers were, and he ran into trouble almost immediately with state gambling regulators, who insisted that he get a casino license even though he had no experience in the gambling industry.</p>
<p>After months of legal battles and regulatory limbo, Straub finally gave up trying to reopen Revel and put it up for sale in February 2015. But he failed to get any serious buyers interested in taking over the property and eventually pulled it off the market.</p>
