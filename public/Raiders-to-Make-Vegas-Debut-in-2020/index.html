        <h1 id="Raiders-to-Make-Vegas-Debut-in-2020"><a href="#Raiders-to-Make-Vegas-Debut-in-2020" class="headerlink" title="Raiders to Make Vegas Debut in 2020"></a>Raiders to Make Vegas Debut in 2020</h1><p>The Oakland Raiders will make their debut in Las Vegas in 2020 at the new stadium being built there, owner Mark Davis confirmed Wednesday.</p>
<p>“We’re going to do it,” Davis said of the move.</p>
<p>The Raiders have been negotiating with the Las Vegas Stadium Authority for months about moving from Oakland to Nevada. The stadium is expected to cost $1.9 billion and will be funded in part by a hotel tax increase approved by the state Legislature last year.</p>
<p>Davis said he still needs to work out details with the NFL about the move but is confident it will happen. He also said he was committed to keeping the team’s name and logo.</p>
<p>The Raiders are the third NFL franchise to announce a move to Las Vegas in recent years. The Rams moved from St. Louis to Los Angeles in 2016 and the Chargers announced they will move from San Diego to LA this year.</p>
<h1 id="Las-Vegas-Welcomes-the-Raiders-with-Open-Arms"><a href="#Las-Vegas-Welcomes-the-Raiders-with-Open-Arms" class="headerlink" title="Las Vegas Welcomes the Raiders with Open Arms"></a>Las Vegas Welcomes the Raiders with Open Arms</h1><p>Raiders owner Mark Davis is finalizing a deal to move the Raiders to Las Vegas. The vote by the NFL owners took place on Monday, and the move was approved 31-1.</p>
<p>The Raiders will play in a $1.9 billion stadium that is being built by Las Vegas Sands Corp. CEO Sheldon Adelson and Majestic Realty Co.’s Dean Spanos. The stadium is expected to be completed in 2020.</p>
<p>This move has been in the works for quite some time, and it is finally official. The Raiders will leave Oakland after their last game of the 2017 season.</p>
<p>The reaction from the city of Las Vegas has been positive. “I am so excited for Mark Davis and the Raiders,” said Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman. “This is a historic moment for our city and for sports in America.”</p>
<p>Goodman went on to say that she expects the stadium to be a tourist attraction, as well as a venue for major sporting events and concerts. “The stadium will be a world-class facility that will help us attract new businesses and tourists to our city,” she said.</p>
<p>There has also been excitement from casino companies like MGM Resorts International, which plans on adding a football-themed casino resort near the stadium site. “We are excited about the opportunity to help make this new stadium what everyone expects it to be – the most iconic and fan-friendly destination in all of sports,” said MGM CEO Jim Murren.</p>
<p> NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell applauded the decision, saying that it was good for the league and forLas Vegas. “The Raiders belong in Oakland,” he said, “but we understand their need for a new home and we are committed to working with them to make sure that happens.”</p>
<p>When Mark Davis first expressed interest in moving his team to Las Vegas, many people were skeptical. After all, Sin City isn’t exactly known for its love of football. But with Monday’s vote by the NFL owners, it’s now official: The Raiders are moving to Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The vote was 31-1 in favor of the move, with only the Miami Dolphins opposed. The Raiders will leave Oakland after their last game of the 2017 season and play in a new $1.9 billion stadium that’s being built by Las Vegas Sands Corp CEO Sheldon Adelson and Majestic Realty Co.’s Dean Spanos. It’s expected to be completed in 2020.</p>
<h1 id="The-Raiders-are-Headed-to-Las-Vegas"><a href="#The-Raiders-are-Headed-to-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="The Raiders are Headed to Las Vegas"></a>The Raiders are Headed to Las Vegas</h1><p>In a stunning turn of events, the Oakland Raiders have been approved to move to Las Vegas. The vote came on Monday night at the NFL owners meetings, with a 31-1 approval. This is after years of NFL attempts to keep the team in Oakland. The Raiders will now have to work out a lease agreement with UNLV for the use of their stadium.</p>
<p>This move is bittersweet for Raider fans. On one hand, they will be able to see their team in a brand new stadium that is sure to be top-notch. On the other hand, they are losing their team and tradition. The Raiders have been playing in Oakland since 1960 and this move marks the end of an era.</p>
<p>Las Vegas has waited a long time for an NFL team and they are now getting one that is coming off a 12-4 season. The Raiders are expected to start playing in Vegas in 2020 and they should be one of the most popular teams in town from day one. With a young roster and a new stadium, the future looks bright for the Raiders.</p>
<h1 id="Oakland-Loses-the-Raiders-but-Gains-a-New-Casino"><a href="#Oakland-Loses-the-Raiders-but-Gains-a-New-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Oakland Loses the Raiders, but Gains a New Casino"></a>Oakland Loses the Raiders, but Gains a New Casino</h1><p>Oakland, long known as a city with a storied past in both the sports and entertainment industries, recently suffered a huge loss. The Oakland Raiders football team announced they were moving to Las Vegas. This was a bitter pill for many in the city to swallow, as the Raiders had been part of Oakland since 1960. However, it was also recently announced that Oakland would be getting a new casino - something that would help to offset the blow of losing the Raiders.</p>
<p>The new casino is set to be built by the same company that is building the new Las Vegas Raiders stadium. It is expected to be open in 2020 and will have 3,000 slot machines and 125 gaming tables. It will also have a 24-hour café, a 2,500-seat theater, and several restaurants. This is great news for Oakland residents who are looking for new entertainment options - especially given that the city’s only other casino, Paragon, closed down in late 2016.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how much revenue the new casino will bring in, but it’s sure to be welcomed by Oakland residents who are looking for ways to spend their time and money. The city has long been known as a foodie destination, with some of the best restaurants in California located there, and the addition of a new casino will only enhance that reputation. So even though losing the Raiders was difficult for many in Oakland, the future looks bright thanks to the new casino.</p>
<h1 id="Oakland-Raiders-Fined-for-Violating-League-Rules"><a href="#Oakland-Raiders-Fined-for-Violating-League-Rules" class="headerlink" title="Oakland Raiders Fined for Violating League Rules"></a>Oakland Raiders Fined for Violating League Rules</h1><p>On Thursday, the NFL announced that the Oakland Raiders were fined $312,500 for violating league rules on reporting injuries. This is not the first time that the Raiders have been penalized by the NFL; they were also fined in 2009 for improper reporting of players’ injuries.</p>
<p>The Raiders violated league rules when they did not report linebacker Marquis Flowers’ hip injury during offseason workouts. Flowers ended up needing surgery to repair his hip, and he is expected to miss the start of the season.</p>
<p>According to NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy, teams are required to report any player who misses practice due to an injury. “The failure to disclose this information violated league rules,” McCarthy said.</p>
<p>Raiders coach Jack Del Rio was disappointed with the team’s violation of league rules. “It’s something we need to do better,” he said. “We’re going to do a better job as an organization.”</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the Raiders have been fined by the NFL; they were also fined in 2009 for improper reporting of players’ injuries.</p>
