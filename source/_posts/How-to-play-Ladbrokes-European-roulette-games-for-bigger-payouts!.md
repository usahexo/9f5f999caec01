#  Playing different roulette games at Ladbrokes

Ladbrokes Casino offers an extensive range of roulette games, each with their own unique rules and betting options. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned gambler, there’s sure to be a roulette game to suit your style. In this article, we take a look at some of the most popular roulette variants available at Ladbrokes Casino.

# European Roulette

European Roulette is the most popular variant of roulette, and is played with a single green zero slot on the wheel. This game offers players the chance to bet on individual numbers or groups of numbers, as well as on red or black, odd or even, and high or low. The minimum bet for European Roulette is just £1, making it a great choice for budget-conscious gamblers.

# American Roulette

American Roulette is similar to European Roulette, but features an extra zero slot on the wheel (making 38 slots in total). This increases the house edge slightly and means that American Roulette is slightly less favourable for players than its European counterpart. The minimum bet for American Roulette starts at £2.

# French Roulette

French Roulette is similar to European Roulette, but features a number of additional betting options including betting on specific rows of numbers and colours (e.g., 1-18 Rouge or 19-36 Noir). The minimum bet for French Roulette starts at £2.50.

# Multi Wheel Roulette

Multi Wheel Roulette allows players to bet on up to 8 different wheels simultaneously, increasing their chances of winning big payouts. Bets can be placed on individual numbers or groups of numbers, as well as on red or black, odd or even, and high or low. Minimum bets start at just 25p per spin.

2. Don’t bet on red or black

When you’re betting on red or black, you have a 50/50 chance of winning, but the odds aren’t great if you want to make a profit. It’s much better to spread your bets across other areas of the table where the odds are better.

3. Bet on specific numbers

The odds are better when betting on specific numbers than they are when betting on red or black, so this is a good strategy if you want to increase your chances of winningnings money from Ladbrokes roulette games. Try to pick numbers that haven’t been hit recently – this gives you a better chance of cashing in when your number comes up!
