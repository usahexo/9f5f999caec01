#  When did people start exchanging gifts at Christmas?

The exchanging of gifts at Christmas is a tradition that has been around for centuries. Although the precise origin of this tradition is unknown, there are several plausible theories about how it began.

One popular theory is that the tradition of exchanging gifts at Christmas originated with the wise men who visited Jesus shortly after he was born. According to the Bible, these men gave Jesus presents of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. It is possible that other people began to emulate the wise men by giving gifts to their friends and family members at Christmas time.

Another theory suggests that the tradition of gift-giving at Christmas began as a way to celebrate the winter solstice. The winter solstice occurs on December 21st each year, and it marks the shortest day of the year. Some people may have begun exchanging gifts as a way to bring cheer to people during what can be a dark time of year.

Whatever its origins may be, the tradition of exchanging gifts at Christmas is now a cherished part of many cultures around the world. People often enjoy selecting special gifts for their loved ones during this festive time of year.

#  Why do people give each other presents at Christmas?

One of the most common questions about Christmas is why people give each other presents. This custom can be traced back to the Roman festival of Saturnalia, which was held in honor of Saturn, the god of agriculture. During this celebration, people exchanged gifts with each other.

The tradition of giving presents at Christmas was brought to Britain by Saint Nicholas, who was born in Turkey in the 4th century. According to legend, Saint Nicholas became a bishop and gave away all his money to help the poor. He was also known for leaving gifts in the shoes of people who left them out to dry overnight.

In the 18th century, Christmas became a popular holiday in Britain. The custom of giving presents gradually spread to other countries. Today, giving presents is a universal custom that is enjoyed by people all over the world.
