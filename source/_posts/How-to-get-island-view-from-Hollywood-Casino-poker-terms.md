#  10 Things You Didn't Know About Island View at Hollywood Casino Poker Terms 

When it comes to poker, most people think they have a pretty good understanding of the game. However, even those who play regularly may not know everything there is to know about the game. Here are 10 things you may not know about poker:

1. The ranking of hands is not necessarily the same in all variants of the game. For example, while a flush is still the best hand in standard poker, in some variants a straight flush can beat a flush.

2. In some versions of poker, like Omaha, there are four card hands (instead of just two), which means that there are several different ways to make a winning hand.

3. In limit poker, there is a maximum number of bets that can be made during each betting round. This makes the game more strategic, as players cannot simply bet all their chips on one hand.

4. Poker is often played as part of a casino gaming suite, but it can also be played online or at home with friends.

5. While Texas Hold’em is the most popular version of poker, there are actually many different variants of the game, each with its own set of rules and strategies.

6. A royal flush is the best possible hand in poker and consists of an Ace-King-Queen-Jack-Ten all of the same suit.

7. Poker is believed to have originated from a 16th century Persian game called As Nas. This early form of the game was played with 5 cards and was known as “the Game of Kings” because only wealthy people could afford to play it.

8. There are three different types of betting in poker - fixed limit, pot limit and no limit. The type of betting used in any given game will affect the strategy you use and the amount you can win or lose.

9. A “full house” is when you have three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank in your hand - for example three sixes and two kings). This combination ranks higher than either two pair or three of a kind.

10. In some cases you can win even if your hand doesn’t rank highest possible - for example if you have four sevens against someone else’s four eights, you would still win as long as all other players folded their hands
