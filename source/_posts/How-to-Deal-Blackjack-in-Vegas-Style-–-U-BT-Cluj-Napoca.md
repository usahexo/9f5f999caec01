#  How to Deal Blackjack in Vegas Style – U-BT Cluj-Napoca

You want to enjoy a Vegas-style blackjack game when you are in town for the U-BT Cluj-Napoca? Look no further, as we will teach you how to play the game like a pro!

To begin with, you will need to place a bet – we recommend starting with low bets and gradually increasing them as you become more comfortable with the game. Your goal is to beat the dealer and achieve a total of 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over.

In blackjack, each card has a specific value: 2 through 10 are worth face value, while an ace can be counted as 1 or 11, depending on what is most beneficial for your hand. The first player to act is the one seated on the dealer’s left and thereafter players act in clockwise order. You must take at least one card, but you may take as many cards as you like (up to but not including 21). The aim is then to discard any number of cards until your hand totals between 17 and 21. If your hand exceeds 21, you ‘bust’ and automatically lose regardless of what the dealer has.

Once all players have acted, the dealer will give each player two cards face up and one card face down. The facedown card is called the ‘hole card’. The dealer then flips over his facedown card; if this card is an ace, he will offer insurance to players. Insurance protects your bet against the dealer having a blackjack (an ace and a 10), in which case you would lose only your original bet rather than both your original bet and your insurance. To accept insurance, simply place another bet equal to half of your original bet in front of you. If the dealer doesn’t have blackjack, you lose this additional bet.

If the hole card is anything other than an ace, the dealer checks his other card to see if he has blackjack; if he does not have blackjack, play continues as normal. If the dealer does have blackjack, all players who have not yet busted are immediately losing their bets whether they have seen their own cards or not (unless they also have a blackjack). If a player has blackjack, he immediately wins unless the dealer also has blackjack – in which case it is a tie (called ‘push’).

Now that we know how to play basic blackjack, let’s look at some of the more advanced strategies that can help us win more money! First off, always remember that it is better to stay on 17 or above rather than try to hit and risk busting; likewise, if you have 16 or below don’t stand but instead hit until you reach 17 or above. This may seem like common sense but beginners often get impatient and stray from these basic rules!

Another key strategy is known as ‘doubling down’. This occurs when you place an additional wager equal to your original bet and receive just one more card from the dealer. If this card improves your hand (combining it with your first two cards gives you a total of 11 or more), then it is always advantageous to double down – even if this means exceeding 21! Conversely however, if this extra card makes your hand worse (e.g., doubles 8 into 16) then it’s usually best not to double down after all!

There are plenty of other tips and tricks that can help improve your chances of winning at blackjack – feel free to ask any casino staff members for advice next time you are playing! With enough practice, eventually you too could be beating dealers in Vegas style – right here in Cluj-Napoca!

#  Study Shows How to Beat the Casino at Blackjack – U-BT Cluj-Napoca

Cluj-Napoca, Romania – September 1, 2017

In a study released today by U-BT Cluj-Napoca, researchers identify the best betting strategy for blackjack players looking to beat the casino. The study is based on a simulation of over two million hands of blackjack.

Researchers found that the most successful betting strategy is to double down on your first two cards only when your total is 9, 10, or 11. This strategy yields a return of 2.3% over the house edge. Other bets in the game offer less favorable odds for players, so it is important to stick to this basic strategy if you want to have any chance of winning.

“Our findings confirm what many experienced blackjack players have long suspected – that doubling down provides the best opportunity to beat the casino at this popular game,” said Dr. Ioan Tomescu of U-BT Cluj-Napoca.

The study also found that jacking up your bets in an attempt to win more money faster is not a wise decision. In fact, doing so actually decreases your chances of winning and increases the amount you stand to lose. So be patient and stick with the basic strategy – it may not be as exciting as going all in every hand, but it will give you the best chance of coming out ahead at the end of the day.

#  How to Play Blackjack Like a Pro in 10 Simple Steps – U-BT Cluj-Napoca

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world. The premise is simple – draw cards and try to get as close to 21 as possible without going bust. However, there are plenty of nuances that can affect your chances of winning, which is why it’s important to understand the basics before you start playing.

In this article, we will teach you how to play blackjack like a pro in 10 simple steps. So, whether you’re a beginner or an experienced player, read on and learn everything you need to know about this iconic casino game.

1) Familiarize yourself with the basic rules

Before playing blackjack, it’s important to familiarize yourself with the basic rules. This way, you’ll have a better understanding of how the game works and what you can do to improve your odds of winning.

The basic rules of blackjack are as follows:

– The game is played with one or more decks of 52 cards.

– The player and dealer are both dealt two cards each. The player’s first card is face up and the second card is face down (known as the hole card). The dealer’s first card is face down and the second card is face up.

– The aim of the game is to draw cards until your total value equals 21 (or comes as close as possible) without going over 21. If your total value exceeds 21, then you have ‘gone bust’ and automatically lose the hand. If your total value is higher than that of the dealer, you win the hand (assuming he doesn’t go bust too).If your total value matches that of the dealer, then it’s a ‘push’ and neither player wins or loses.

2) Decide how much money you want to bet

Another important thing to consider before playing blackjack is how much money you want to bet. This will depend on your budget and betting limits, so make sure you choose a sum that comfortable for you. You can always increase or decrease your bet amount later on, but it’s best to start off with a figure that you feel comfortable with.


3) Place your bets
Now that you know how much money you want to bet, it’s time to place your bets. In blackjack, there are three types of bets that you can make: 1) Standard bets; 2) Insurance bets; 3) Side bets11}. Standard bets are placed against the dealer and involve betting on whether or not your hand will beat his hand. Insurance bets are placed when the dealer has an Ace showing and involve betting on whether or not he will hit Blackjack (i.e., get a total value of 21). Side bets are placed independently of the main game and typically involve wagering on various combinations of hands (e.g., two pairs, etc). We won’t go into too much detail here – just be aware that there are different types of bets that you can make in blackjack.

4) Draw cards until your total equals 21 (or comes close)

Once all players have placed their bets, it’s time for them to draw cards until their total equals 21 (or comes close). In order to do this, they must first reveal their hidden card (the hole card). At this point, they can either hit (draw another card), stand (stick with their current total), double down ( doubles their bet amountand draws one more card), split (splits their hand into two separate hands if they have two cards of equal rank), or surrender (abandons half their bet amount and gives up their hand). Again, we won’t go into too much detail here – just be aware of these possibilities when playing blackjack.

5) Compare totals and decide who wins As we mentioned earlier, the aim of blackjack is to draw cards until your total value equals 21 (or comes as close as possible). Once both players have revealed their hidden cards and made any necessary moves, it becomes clear who has won the hand. If your total value exceeds 21 then automatically lose regardlessof what Dealer's final Total may be . If Dealer's final Total=21 same goes for Player Side wagers; if greater=winner 

6) Collect winnings/payout any losses Once both players have settled their hands, any winnings/losses need to be paid out accordingly . 

7 Now let us move onto some tips which may help increase ones chances when gambling at live casino games such as Black Jack Do keep track while counting coupons which gives gamblers an increased advantage over house edge offered by casinos Play using perfect strategy unless comfort dictates deviation for psychological reasons Remember ; " A gambler who does not know enough about probabilities may think he has an advantage where he has none

Card counting can be tricky to learn but once you have it down, it can be a powerful tool in your arsenal.

Kelly betting is another advanced strategy that can help you win big at blackjack.

#  Learn How to Win at Blackjack from the Pros – U-BT Cluj-Napoca

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world. While the game seems simple enough to play, there is more to it than meets the eye. In order to win consistently at blackjack, you need to understand the rules of the game and how to use strategy to your advantage.

In this article, we will teach you the basics of blackjack and how to improve your odds of winning. We will also give you some tips from professional blackjack players so that you can start winning like a pro.

The Basics of Blackjack

Blackjack is a card game that is played against the dealer. The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The player can hit (draw another card) or stand (stick with what they have). If the player goes over 21, they bust and lose the hand.

If the dealer has a higher hand than the player, the player loses. If the two hands are equal, it is called a push and no one wins or loses money.

In blackjack, there are two important factors to consider – your hand total and the dealer’s upcard. The dealers upcard is the card that is face up on the table. This card tells you how strong the dealers hand is and whether you should take additional cards (hit) or stand pat (stand).

For example, if you have a hand total of 14 and the dealers upcard is a 5, then you should hit because there is a good chance that their downcard will be low (i.e., 2-4). On the other hand, if you have a hand total of 16 and the dealers upcard is an ace, then you should stand because their downcard could be any number from 2-10 and still beat your hand total of 16.

Basic Blackjack Strategy

Now that you know how to play blackjack, let’s take a look at some basic strategy guidelines that can help improve your odds of winning:

1) Always split pairs of eights or Aces. When you are dealt two cards of equal value, you can choose to split them into two separate hands by placing another bet equal to your original wager. This gives you twice as many chances to win. Splitting pairs of Aces also allows you to double down after splitting (more on this later).

2) Hit when your hand total is between 12 and 16 inclusive, and stand when your hand total is 17 or more inclusive. This strategy gives you about a 50/50 chance of winning against most dealer upcards. Remember that when playing blackjack, it’s better to stand on hard totals (17-21) than risk busting out with a weak hit hand (12-16).

3) Double down when your hand total equals 10 or 11 points ONLY . Doubling down means that you are doubling your original bet and getting just one more card from the deck. This option should be used when you have a good chance of winning with another card since it increases your risk by doubling your bet amount. So, only use this option when it gives you an edge over the dealer’s upcard. For example, if you are dealt 10 points in your initial two cards and are facing a 3 point dealer upcard then doubling down would give You an advantage over taking another card.(3+10)/2=7point advantage wich ways in ur favor so hitting would not be advises 

 4) Always take insurance when offered . Insurance is simply a side bet offered by the dealer which pays out 2:1 if he has blackjack (a suited ace and any ten-valued card). Since getting blackjack pays out 3:2 on your original bet amount, insurance offers an easy way to make money if Lady Luck happens to smile upon you at Casino U-BT Cluj-Napoca . Just remember that this side bet should only be taken when You have less than 20 points in Your first two cards combined ; anything more than 20 points means insurance isn’t worth taking .

5) Stay away from betting on ties . Unless You are feeling lucky today , avoid betting on ties as they offer very poor odds for players .
